## Overview
The PID Ball Balancer is a hands-on control systems project designed to explore real-time feedback,
hardware–software integration, and embedded programming.

The system balances a ball at the center of a beam regardless of its starting position by continuously
adjusting the beam angle using a servo motor.

---

## System Objective
- Detect the ball’s position using an ultrasonic sensor
- Compute error relative to the center of the beam
- Apply PID control to adjust the beam angle
- Maintain stable balance through continuous feedback

---

## Hardware Used
- Raspberry Pi Model B+
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor
- Servo Motor
- Breadboard and GPIO Extension Board
- Resistors and Jumper Wires
- LEGO-based beam structure

---

## Software & Control
- Python (Thonny IDE)
- Raspberry Pi GPIO libraries
- PID control algorithm

---

## Challenges
- PID tuning to avoid oscillations
- Hardware limitations affecting software timing
- Debugging sensor noise and wiring issues
- Aligning sensor orientation and beam angle

---

## Key Learnings
- Real-world PID control differs from theory
- Hardware–software compatibility is critical
- Iterative debugging and testing are essential
- Low-cost materials can still enable effective engineering systems
